# React boilerplate

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/c667037d3f2152120b0eefc6bdef95e6b3c578503d93d090aa.svg)](https://buildkite.com/tabcorp/offer-management-tool)

## Starting the dev server

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

1. Run `npm install`
2. Start the dev server using `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Available Commands

- `npm start` - start the dev server
- `npm clean` - delete the dist folder
- `npm run production` - create a production ready build in `dist` folder
- `npm run lint` - execute an eslint check
- `npm test` - run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - run all tests in watch mode
- `npm run coverage` - generate code coverage report in the `coverage` folder

## Vendor Exporting

You can export specific vendors in separate files and load them. All vendors should be included in `app/vendors` and will be exported in a `vendors` folder under `dist`. The main idea is to serve independent JavaScript and CSS libraries, though currently all file formats are supported.

! Don't forget to add the vendors in `app/index.html` and `build/index.html`.

## Code Coverage

The project is using the Jest Code Coverage tool. The reports are generated by running `npm run coverage`. All configurations are located in `package.json`, inside the `jest` object.

The coverage report consists of an HTML reporter, which can be viewed in the browser and some helper coverage files like the coverage json and xml file.

## Production code

Run `npm run production`. The production-ready code will be located under `dist` folder.

## Environments & Deployment examples

There are UAT, PreProd, and Production environments.
Details of these environments and the entire system can be found in the [Environment Details](https://tabcorp-digital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DT/pages/136777169/Environment+Details) page of the wiki.

Configuration settings for the environments is managed in the Git Repo [redbook-config-files/offer-management-tool](https://github.tabcorp.com.au/TabDigital/offer-management-tool). Deployment of these configuration values to the environments is done via the GoCD pipeline [redbookci/offer-management-tool-config](https://redbookci.tabdigital.com.au/go/tab/pipeline/history/offer-management-tool-config).

Deployment of the application itself is done via the GoCD pipeline [redbookci/offer-management-tool-deployment](https://redbookci.tabdigital.com.au/go/tab/pipeline/history/offer-management-tool-deployment). By default the pipeline deploys the last successful build on the "master" code branch.

## Tools that shine

- `ramda` pure functional library (highly recommended)
- `date-fns` date and time related functions
